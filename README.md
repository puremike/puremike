## 💼 About Me

I'm a **DevOps Engineer** with a passion for building efficient, scalable systems. I work across the full lifecycle of software, from infrastructure automation to application development — creating tools and services that power real-time, distributed, high-performance APIs, and cloud-native systems using modern backend architectures.

### What I do:
- ⚙️ **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform, Ansible, Helm)
- ☁️ **Cloud & Container Platforms** (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes)
- 🧠 **Distributed Systems** and **Microservices**
- 🧪 **CI/CD Automation** and **Monitoring**
- 🛠️ **Backend Engineering in Golang and Java (SpringBoot)**

Currently, I'm also exploring **Rust** at a steady pace—curious about systems-level safety and performance.
