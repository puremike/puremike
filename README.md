# 👋 Hi, I'm Michael,

# 🚀 Backend Engineer (Golang | FastAPI | Microservices | AWS)
High-performance Golang Specialist building scalable APIs and distributed systems. I focus on writing clean, efficient code and architecting microservices that handle high-throughput traffic with ease.

### About Me
I am a Backend Engineer who builds the core infrastructure behind modern applications. I specialise in crafting high-concurrency server-side logic and designing decoupled systems that are optimised for speed and long-term maintainability. With deep expertise in Golang, Kubernetes, and AWS, I bridge the gap between application code and infrastructure. My goal is to deliver production-ready services that are secure, container-optimised, and built to scale from day one. Backend Specialist focused on building high-performance microservices, scalable APIs, and real-time distributed systems. I leverage my background in cloud-native infrastructure to write production-ready code that scales.

**What I do:**
- 🧠 **Microservices Architecture:** Designing decoupled, resilient systems using Go and Java.
- ⚡ **High-Performance APIs:** Building async and real-time services with FastAPI and WebSockets.
- 📊 **Reliability & Monitoring:** Implementing Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry for full-stack observability and SLO tracking.
- ⚙️ **Production-Ready Engineering:** Ensuring code is container-optimised and ready for Kubernetes.
- 🧪 **System Design:** Implementing caching (Redis), messaging queues, and database optimisation.
