# 👋 Hi, I'm Michael,

# 🚀 Backend Engineer (Golang | Java Spring Boot | FastAPI)

Backend Specialist focused on building high-performance microservices, scalable APIs, and real-time distributed systems. I leverage my background in cloud-native infrastructure to write production-ready code that scales.

### 💼 About Me
I’m a Backend Engineer who builds the "engine" behind modern applications. I specialise in crafting efficient server-side logic and architecting microservices that are optimised for performance and reliability. 

While I have deep expertise in **Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS**, my focus is on using these tools to support robust application development, ensuring that every service I build is scalable and secure from the first commit.

**What I do:**
- 🧠 **Microservices Architecture:** Designing decoupled, resilient systems using Go and Java.
- ⚡ **High-Performance APIs:** Building async and real-time services with FastAPI and WebSockets.
- ⚙️ **Production-Ready Engineering:** Ensuring code is container-optimised and ready for Kubernetes.
- 🧪 **System Design:** Implementing caching (Redis), messaging queues, and database optimisation.
